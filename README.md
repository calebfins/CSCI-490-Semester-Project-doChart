# CSCI-490-Semester-Project-doChart
##DoChart program
###Description
This project was created by myself and my team as a school project for an upper level programming course. It is a rudimentary web based electroinic health record program, meant for small medical practices.
###Technologies Used
For this program, my team combined HTML + CSS for the frontend, and PHP + SQL to run the backend.
